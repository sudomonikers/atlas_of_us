# Knowledge Base Nodes

Knowledge Bases are the umbrella term for any knowledge or ideas or beliefs a person can know about or have awareness of. It encompasses many different things from physics to programming to christianity to economics to political ideologies and history. A basic Knowledge Base will look like this:

```jsx
{
	Properties: {
		name: string
		description: string
		reference: href
	},
	Labels: ['Knowledge_Base'],
}
```

It may have these relationships with other entities:

```jsx
(kb1:Knowledge_Base)-[RELATES_TO {strength: range[0-100]}]->(kb2:Knowledge_Base)
(kb1:Knowledge_Base)-[REQUIRES_PREVIOUS_KNOWLEDGE]->(kb2:Knowledge_Base)

(p:Person)-[KNOWS_ABOUT {strength: range[0-100]}->(kb:Knowledge_Base)
(p:Person)-[WANTS_TO_LEARN {reason: string}->(kb:Knowledge_Base)
```

A knowledge base node can be one of several types (denoted by the label), we will start with these few:

- Provable
- Theoretical
- Philosophical
- Procedural

## Provable

Each Provable node needs to have proof and will look something like this:

```jsx
{
	Properties: {
		name: string
		description: string
		reference: href
		proof: href
	},
	Labels: ['Knowledge_Base', 'Provable'],
}
```

## Theoretical

Each Theoretical node contains a theory on how the world works, but is not provable. This includes things like experiential knowledge, tacit knowledge, gut feelings etc. (As well as actual scientific theories that simply have not been proven yet)

```jsx
{
	Properties: {
		name: string
		description: string
		reference: href
	},
	Labels: ['Knowledge_Base', 'Theoretical'],
}
```

Theoretical nodes may have these additional relationships:

```jsx
(p:Person)-[BELIEVES_THEORY {strength: range[0-100]}]->(t:Theoretical)
(p:Person)-[DISBELIEVES_THEORY {reason: string}]->(t:Theoretical)
```

## Philosophical

Philosophical nodes are that which are not knowledge bases about how life is or how life works, but rather musings on how things should be. They are things that are not necessarily right or wrong, and could never be proven ‘correct’.

```jsx
{
	Properties: {
		name: string
		description: string
		reference: href
	},
	Labels: ['Knowledge_Base', 'Philoshophical'],
}
```

Philosophical nodes may have these additional relationships:

```jsx
(p:Person)-[BELIEVES_IN {strength: range[0-100]]->(p:Philosophical)
(p:Person)-[THINKS_THIS_IS_WRONG {reason: string]->(p:Philosophical)
```

## Procedural

Procedural knowledge is neither ‘provable’ nor ‘theoretical’ but more knowledge of how to do something. For example how to change a light bulb or how to program in javascript
```jsx
{
	Properties: {
		name: string
		description: string
		reference: href
	},
	Labels: ['Knowledge_Base', 'Procedural'],
}
```
