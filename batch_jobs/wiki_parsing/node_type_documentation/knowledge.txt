Knowledge Documentation

Knowledge nodes represent any knowledge or ideas or beliefs a person can know about or have awareness of. It encompasses many different things from physics to programming to christianity to economics to political ideologies and history. There are several sub types of pursuits nodes, and they are as follows:

- Provable: Knowledge which can be proven as true in some way.
- Theoretical: Knowledge on how the world works, but is not provable. This includes things like experiential knowledge, tacit knowledge, gut feelings etc. (As well as actual scientific theories that simply have not been proven yet)
- Philosophical: Knowledge that addresses normative, ethical, and value-based questions about how things ought to be or should be approached. This includes moral principles, ethical frameworks, value systems, and broader philosophical concepts that cannot be proven "correct" in an objective sense. Examples include ethical theories (utilitarianism, deontology), political philosophies, religious/spiritual belief systems, aesthetic judgments, and conceptual frameworks for understanding meaning, purpose, and the good life.
- Procedural: Knowledge which is neither ‘provable’ nor ‘theoretical’ but more knowledge of how to do something. For example how to change a light bulb or how to program in javascript
- Contextual: Knowledge that is specific to cultural contexts, social norms, or local practices that may not be universal but are essential within certain communities or situations.
- Heuristic: Knowledge based on "rules of thumb" or mental shortcuts that are useful for quick decision-making but aren't necessarily proven or procedural.
- Historical: Knowledge about past events, trends, and developments that may not fit neatly into the "Provable" category since historical knowledge often involves interpretation.

A basic Knowledge node will look like this:

```jsx
{
	Properties: {
		name: string
		description: string
		reference: href
	},
	Labels: ['L1', 'Knowledge'], //This will also have a label for the subtype of knowledge that it is, for example 'Philisophical'
}
```

‘Knowledge’ can have the following relationships with other nodes:

L3 - ‘Person’ nodes can have these relationships with ‘Knowledge’ nodes

```jsx

(p:Person)-[KNOWS {strength: range[0-100]}]->(k:Knowledge)
(p:Person)-[WANTS_TO_LEARN {reason: string}]->(k:Knowledge)
```

The default assumption is that if a ‘Person’ does not have a relationship with a ‘Knowledge’ node, then that ‘Person’ does not have any knowledge of it at all and never has.

L2 - L2 nodes relationships with Knowledge are explained in the L2 Document

L1 - ‘Knowledge’ nodes can have these relationships with the other L1 nodes
