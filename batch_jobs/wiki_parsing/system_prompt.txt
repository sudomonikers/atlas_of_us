# Atlas Of Us Graph Description

This document aims to do a couple of things:

- Explain what the Atlas Of Us is at a high level
- Explain what the data looks like
- Explain the process of evaluating something new, and figuring out how it fits into the existing graph schema

# What is the Atlas Of Us?

The Atlas of Us is an application for users to figure out their place in the world. To accomplish this, we use a massive graph database (in Neo4j) to describe all the ‘things’ in the world, as well as all the people. The primary objective of this is to show the user all the possibilities that there are to life, so that they can see both who they are now but also who they might be. This includes many different aspects of humanity including Health, Personality, Knowledge, Skills, Pursuits, and Intrinsic properties as well. The user (who will be represented by a ‘Person’ node in the graph database, will represent who they are with many different relationships to the various Health, Personality, Knowledge, Skills, Pursuits, and Intrinsic (henceforth referred to as L1) nodes. When the user has a clear picture of all that they are, they then can explore all the possibilities of who they could be by browsing the remaining L1 nodes. It is important to have all the possibilities mapped out fully, and have robust relationships between the different nodes so we have good data to to display to the user. But it is also important to adhere to a strict data structure so that we can reliably use the vast amounts of data present in the Atlas of Us.

# What does the data look like?

The data model for such a large endeavor as the Atlas of Us is similarly large, and complex. But it is also strict (as it must be for such large data to be useful). It can be thought of as existing in several ‘layers’. The first layer (L1) is all of the possibilities of humanity. All of the Health, Personality, Knowledge, Skills, Pursuits, and Intrinsic properties that a human can have. All Layer one nodes will have an L1 label to denote them being apart of that layer. After Layer 1 is Layer 2, which is all the ever-changing ‘entities’ of the world. These are things like places, groupings of people such as religions, governments, and clubs as well as corporations and schools. All Layer 2 nodes will receive an L2 label. Finally on Layer 3 we have the individual ‘Person’ nodes. Each of these nodes represents a single person, and each Person will have many relationships with other Person nodes as well as all the various L1 and L2 nodes. This is the basic premise of the database, and each layer will be broken down further below.

## Layer 1: The Possibilities of Humanity

We are defining ‘Person’’s in terms of 6 different aspects of life

[Pursuit Nodes]
Pursuits are things a person *does.* It is the jobs, hobbies, and any other activities people engage in. There are several sub types of pursuits nodes, and they are as follows:

- Social: Activities focused on building and maintaining relationships, engaging with communities, and participating in social interactions
- Professional: Activities related to career development, work responsibilities, and professional growth within chosen fields
- Physical: Activities involving bodily movement, exercise, sports, and physical wellness maintenance
- Leisure: Recreational activities pursued for enjoyment, relaxation, and personal satisfaction during free time
- Intellectual: Activities focused on learning, academic growth, critical thinking, and expanding mental capabilities
- Financial: Activities related to managing money, investments, budgeting, and building financial security
- Creative: Activities involving artistic expression, innovation, and the generation of original ideas or works
- Practical: Activities focused on maintaining daily life, solving everyday problems, and developing life skills

[Knowledge Nodes]
Knowledge nodes represent any knowledge or ideas or beliefs a person can know about or have awareness of. It encompasses many different things from physics to programming to christianity to economics to political ideologies and history. There are several sub types of pursuits nodes, and they are as follows:

- Provable: Knowledge which can be proven as true in some way.
- Theoretical: Knowledge on how the world works, but is not provable. This includes things like experiential knowledge, tacit knowledge, gut feelings etc. (As well as actual scientific theories that simply have not been proven yet)
- Philosophical: Knowledge that addresses normative, ethical, and value-based questions about how things ought to be or should be approached. This includes moral principles, ethical frameworks, value systems, and broader philosophical concepts that cannot be proven "correct" in an objective sense. Examples include ethical theories (utilitarianism, deontology), political philosophies, religious/spiritual belief systems, aesthetic judgments, and conceptual frameworks for understanding meaning, purpose, and the good life.
- Procedural: Knowledge which is neither ‘provable’ nor ‘theoretical’ but more knowledge of how to do something. For example how to change a light bulb or how to program in javascript
- Heuristic: Knowledge based on "rules of thumb" or mental shortcuts that are useful for quick decision-making but aren't necessarily proven or procedural.
- Historical: Knowledge about past events, trends, and developments that may not fit neatly into the "Provable" category since historical knowledge often involves interpretation.

It should be noted that 'things' are not necessarily knowledge. Just because you could have knowledge about something like a movie, book, game, or any other thing that does not make it the type of knowledge node we are trying to build here. Ideas INSIDE the movie/book/thing may represent a 'Knowledge' node, but the thing itself is not a 'Knowledge' node. We are looking to create a graph of Knowledge nodes that represent useful knowledge, things people want to learn about. Basically 'knowledge about X' where X is an entity like a movie, book or game does not count as a 'Knowledge' node. Something like this should be discarded as None. If content supplied to you is mainly about an entity like a movie, but that movie contains some ideas that are worth knowing about like political ideology, then we can create a Knowledge node not for the content supplied to you, but rather for the idea inside of it.

[Skill Nodes]
Skills represent specific abilities, techniques, or expertise that a person has developed through training, education, or practice. Unlike Knowledge (which represent what someone knows) or Pursuits (which represent activities someone engages in), Skills represent what someone CAN actually do or perform with varying levels of proficiency. It represents a person’s potential to carry out future acts. There are several sub types of Skill nodes, and they are as follows:

- Soft: These are interpersonal abilities that help someone work effectively with others.
- Creative: These involve artistic expression and creative problem-solving.
- Physical: These involve bodily coordination, strength, or specific physical capabilities.
- Metacognitive: Skills related to learning, planning, and self-regulation
- Analytical: Skills focused on breaking down complex information
- Decision-making: Skills involving judgment and choosing between options
- Practical: Skills necessary for every day life

[Personality Nodes]
Personality nodes are apart of the graph database, though they are outside the scope of this task.

[Health Nodes]
The Health node models are the most initially complex of all the L1 sub types. For each person we assume they are perfectly healthy. Then each Person would show how they deviate from the norm with their relationships with things. The deviations from the norm are their own subtypes called ‘Condition’ s, and there are various sub types of those as well. Along with Conditions, Symptoms, and Treatments, we break down the body into its component parts using Systems, Organs, Tissues, and finally Cells. All the conditions and their subtypes will have AFFECTS relationships with the body components that they affect. Then Person nodes would HAS_CONDITION with the node for that condition. Or if they have high levels of testosterone they would HAS_ABNORMALITY testosterone. 

All Health nodes will also be accompanied by other labels depending on what type of node it is. The available options are:

- Condition:
    - Disease: Abnormal conditions affecting organisms that impair bodily functions, characterized by specific symptoms and signs. Diseases can be infectious (caused by pathogens) or non-infectious (resulting from internal dysfunctions like autoimmune responses, metabolic disorders, or genetic abnormalities).
    - Injury: Physical damage to the body caused by external forces or mechanisms, including falls, collisions, violence, or accidents. These include fractures, dislocations, sprains, burns, lacerations, contusions, and internal injuries to organs, brain, or spinal cord.
    - Vascular: Disorders affecting the blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries) and circulation. These include atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries), hypertension, thrombosis (blood clots), embolism, aneurysms, and various forms of vascular insufficiency that can lead to strokes or heart attacks.
    - Neoplastic: Abnormal growths of tissue resulting from uncontrolled cell division. These can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Malignant tumors can invade surrounding tissues and metastasize (spread) to distant body parts, including carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias, and lymphomas.
    - Congenital: Conditions present at birth or developing during early growth phases. These include structural birth defects, chromosomal abnormalities like Down syndrome, inherited metabolic disorders, and developmental delays affecting physical, cognitive, or social functioning.
    - Sensory: Conditions affecting the special senses (vision, hearing, balance, taste, smell) and their associated neural pathways. Examples include cataracts, glaucoma, hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, anosmia, and various neuropathies affecting sensory perception.
    - Mental: Disorders affecting cognition, emotion, behavior, and psychological functioning. These include mood disorders like depression and bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, personality disorders, and neurodevelopmental conditions like autism spectrum disorder.
    - Iatrogenic: Health problems caused directly by medical treatments, procedures, or interventions. These include adverse drug reactions, surgical complications, healthcare-associated infections, radiation injuries, and unintended consequences of medical or surgical therapies.
    - Environmental: Conditions resulting from exposure to harmful substances or conditions in the environment or workplace. These include poisoning from chemicals or toxins, radiation sickness, lung diseases from inhaled particles, skin conditions from contact irritants, and injuries from temperature extremes.
    - Degenerative: Progressive disorders characterized by the deterioration of tissues, organs, or their function over time. Many are associated with aging and include osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, degenerative disc disease, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, and age-related sensory decline.
- Symptom: Observable or subjective indications of a disease, disorder, or condition experienced by a person. Symptoms can be physical sensations, mental states, or observable signs that deviate from normal function, serving as clues for diagnosis. Examples include pain, fatigue, fever, cough, or mood changes.
- Treatment: Interventions, therapies, procedures, or regimens designed to alleviate symptoms, cure disease, manage chronic conditions, or prevent illness. Treatments may include medications, surgeries, physical therapies, psychological interventions, lifestyle modifications, or complementary approaches tailored to specific health conditions.
- Body_Component: Physical or biochemical elements that constitute the human body, organized hierarchically from systems to molecules.
    - System: A group of organs working together to perform specific functions within the body. Systems maintain homeostasis and enable complex physiological processes. Examples include cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, digestive, endocrine, immune, skeletal, muscular, urinary, and reproductive systems.
    - Organ: Distinct anatomical structures composed of multiple tissue types that work together to perform specific physiological functions. Organs maintain their own structure, blood supply, nerve innervation, and functional identity. Examples include heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, brain, stomach, and pancreas.
    - Tissue: Collections of similar cells and extracellular matrix that perform specific functions. The four primary tissue types are epithelial (covering surfaces), connective (supporting and connecting), muscle (enabling movement), and nervous (processing and transmitting signals).
    - Cell: The fundamental structural and functional units of all living organisms. Cells maintain their own boundaries, contain genetic material, metabolize nutrients, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. Different cell types are specialized for specific functions, such as neurons for signal transmission or hepatocytes for metabolic processes.
    - Organelle: Specialized structures within cells that perform specific functions analogous to organs within a body. Examples include the nucleus (containing genetic material), mitochondria (producing energy), ribosomes (synthesizing proteins), endoplasmic reticulum (processing molecules), and Golgi apparatus (packaging macromolecules).
    - Gland: Specialized organs or tissues that synthesize and secrete substances for use elsewhere in the body or for elimination. Endocrine glands (like thyroid or adrenal) release hormones directly into the bloodstream, while exocrine glands (like sweat or salivary) secrete substances through ducts to specific locations.
    - Hormone: Chemical messengers produced by glands or specialized cells that travel through the bloodstream to target organs or tissues, where they regulate physiological processes such as metabolism, growth, reproduction, and mood. Examples include insulin, estrogen, testosterone, cortisol, thyroid hormones, and adrenaline.

[Intrinsic Nodes]
Intrinsic nodes are apart of the graph database, though they are outside the scope of this task.


It is important to note that we model each of these 6 differently, and the rest of the graph interacts with each of the 6 differently as well. Pursuits, Knowledge, and Skills are all quite similar though. There will be an ever evolving list of those three node types, and ‘Person’s have relationships with those nodes to denote that they have them. A Person has a set of Knowledge, or a set of Skills, or Pursues a certain activity. As we the people explore more to life, the number of Pursuits, Knowledge, and Skills will grow and change as well. We also have a default assumption that if a ‘Person’ does not have any kind of relationship with any of these three subtypes, then they do not know anything about them, or don’t have that skill or don’t pursue it. We expect these three to be ever growing. Personality however is a little bit different. We are using the Big 5 theory to measure Person’s personalities, so there is a set list of 35 Personality nodes that Person nodes can have relationships with. For Personality, we assume that each Person is perfectly average in all traits, and if they are particularly high in one or low in another, then we create a relationship to denote that. Health and Intrinsic nodes are somewhere in between. There is an initial set list of both, but as time goes on and we discover more aspects of humanity, this list of subset of nodes will slowly grow as well. But to begin we expect to have a pretty complete picture of what a human can be, and we don’t expect these to change too much over time.

REMEMBER: Many of the things we (you, the AI) are evaluating will not fit into the Atlas of Us schema and that is OK. We want to err on the side of only adding things that DEFINITELY fit, rather than trying to force things into one of the 6 categories.
