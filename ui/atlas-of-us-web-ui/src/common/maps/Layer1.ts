        explanation: "Personality is any person's collection of interrelated behavioral, cognitive, and emotional patterns that comprise a person’s unique adjustment to life. The study of Personality is still an evolving science, and it is still not fully understood what exactly personality is. Regardless, Personality differences have been shown to be one of the strongest predictors of virtually all key life outcomes, from academic, work and relationship success to mental and somatic health and well-being as well as longevity. Here in the Atlas Of Us, we use the Big 5 Theory of Personality to describe a person's behavior, as this seems to be what academic psychologists use themselves. You can read more about the model here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits#Limited_scope",
        howWeMeasure: "While pretty much everything on here is difficult to accurately measure in a self-assessed way, the Atlas Of Us has people individually assign themselves a score of 1-10 for each personality facet based on guided questions.
